# 42Hive-Github-Vogsphere-Actions

This action allows you to focus on setting up your work for a public repository on your personal Github page, and automate the submission process for vogsphere submission.

## Usage
In your current working repository, add a directory from the root of the repository: ./.github/workflows
```
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```
the `-p` option tells `mkdir` to create any intermediate directories as required.

Download the `main.yml` file into the directory `.github/workflows` you just created.
